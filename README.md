# **Objective of the Project**

The goal of this project is to develop a **Task Management Web Application** using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack**. This application should provide users with a seamless experience to manage their tasks, including features such as user authentication, task creation, updating, and deletion, all while ensuring a secure and responsive user interface.

## **Key Features**
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Secure registration and login functionality using JWT-based authentication.

2. **Task Management:**
   - CRUD operations for tasks:
     - Create tasks with a title and description.
     - View a list of tasks.
     - Edit existing tasks.
     - Delete tasks.

3. **Role-Based Access:**
   - Ensure only authenticated users can manage their tasks.

4. **Frontend:**
   - A responsive and user-friendly dashboard for task management.
   - A modern React-based design.

5. **Backend:**
   - RESTful APIs built with Express.js.
   - MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval.

6. **Integration:**
   - Full integration between frontend and backend with proper state management using Redux.

7. **Deployment:**
   - The application will be deployed to platforms such as Heroku (backend) and Netlify (frontend) to provide public access.

## **End Goal**
The final product will be a fully functioning task management application, delivered as a deployable and scalable web application. This project will demonstrate an end-to-end understanding of the MERN stack and good development practices, suitable for inclusion in a portfolio or as a learning challenge for developers.
